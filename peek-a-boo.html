    <h1>Peek-a-boo</h1>
    <p><strong>Peek-a-boo</strong> is an ancient game riddled in mystery and deceit. Though it appears to be an innocent children's pastime, you may change your mind when you learn of its treacherous history.</p>

  <div id="initially-hidden">
    <p>Let's play peek-a-boo. <span class ="clickable">Click here</span> to see the surprise.</p>
  </div>

    <div id="initially-showing">
      <p>What a cute walrus! <span class="clickable">Click here</span> to hide her again.</p>
        <img src="img/walrus.jpg">
    </div>
  </div>

<!--On the walrus page, add some clickable text that alternates between saying "Hide/show images", and toggles the images appropriately. On either the walrus page or the webpage from the previous exercise, try fading and sliding elements with fadeIn(), fadeOut(), fadeToggle(), slideDown(), slideUp(), and slideToggle(). Make a webpage with a few different sections, where a few of the sections are hidden by default, with a bit of teaser text that expands when you click on it (e.g., "Click to learn about the giant sandcastles of this fabulous country!").
